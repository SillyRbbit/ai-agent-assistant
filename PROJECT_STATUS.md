## Verified baseline through Increment 2E

- Tauri launches on the Apple Silicon target Mac.
- React renders in the native main window and invokes typed `get_app_info` IPC.
- SQLite startup is idempotent and persists only the bootstrap marker in development.
- The macOS status-item menu, close-to-hide, menu reopen, Dock reopen, and Quit work.
- The seven-route React shell, Settings diagnostics, Permissions placeholders, and closed menu routing work.
- No operating-system permission prompt appears.

## Increment 2F capability

- In-memory user and assistant messages.
- Fixed deterministic text chunks and progressive streaming.
- Stop with timer cancellation and late-event rejection.
- Mock `create_local_task` activity card.
- Exact mock preview for target, affected data, reversibility, permission, and risk.
- Deterministic approve, reject, and edit outcomes with no execution.
- Edit returns a deterministic draft to the composer.

## Verification evidence

Passed on the target Mac:

```text
npm run lint:frontend
npm run typecheck
targeted Vitest — 3 files, 37 tests
npm run verify
full Vitest — 4 files, 47 tests
Rust library tests — 50 passed
Rust integration tests — 6 passed
Vite production build
Tauri release build --no-bundle
git diff --check
native Tauri development launch
storage startup — idempotent, 2 migrations already applied
```

The project owner confirmed manual progressive streaming, Stop, approve/reject/edit outcomes, Edit draft restoration, minimum-window layout, close/reopen/Dock/quit behavior, Settings diagnostics, idempotent storage startup, and absence of permission prompts all passed.

## Security posture

- The model remains outside the authorization boundary.
- `get_app_info` remains the only custom Tauri command.
- Increment 2F changes frontend source, tests, styles, and project documentation only.
- Capabilities, CSP, Tauri configuration, Rust source, storage, dependencies, and lockfiles are unchanged.
- No model network, API key, OAuth, OS permission, shell, platform automation, or user-data persistence was added.
- WebView approval decisions are explicitly mock-only and cannot authorize or invoke an action.
- Run identifiers and valid-state checks reject stale asynchronous events.

## Increment 2G capability and evidence

- Typed mock-run driver with explicit cancellation.
- Bounded failure copy and deterministic Retry.
- Redacted in-memory Activity feed with no request, argument, result, or error-detail content.
- Stale chunk, completion, and failure events fail closed.

Passed:

```text
npm run verify
Frontend — 6 files, 63 tests passed
Rust library — 50 tests passed
Rust integration — 6 tests passed
Vite production build
Tauri release build --no-bundle
npm audit --audit-level=low — 0 vulnerabilities
git diff --check
```

Native launch passed with idempotent storage startup. The project owner confirmed streaming, Stop, approval decisions, Activity empty and populated states, newest-first lifecycle events, Activity redaction, close/reopen/Dock/quit behavior, Settings diagnostics, and absence of permission prompts all passed.

## Next action

Perform documentation-only Phase 3C gap analysis and define the next bounded increment without changing runtime code.

## Phase 3B planning result

- The verified application has no run-bound disclosure of what information the deterministic mock used.
- The product brief requires users to see what information the agent used, and D-017 identifies conversation identity as the prerequisite.
- The proposed increment adds one fixed-copy provenance record per run, tied to exact run and conversation IDs and stored only in volatile session state.
- The current request is the only source marked used; prior messages, saved memory, device data, and external services are explicitly not used.
- Request text and personal content remain excluded from provenance and Activity.
- Real context selection or collection, trusted provenance, persistence, tool results, networking, dependencies, native capability changes, and permissions remain out of scope.
- Planning baseline passed with TypeScript type checking, 83 frontend tests, and 50 Rust library tests.

## Increment 3B capability and evidence

- Fixed-copy `MockContextProvenance` records bind each run to its volatile conversation.
- Current request is marked used; prior messages, saved memory, device data, and external services are marked not used.
- Provenance constructors accept identifiers only, and the UI states that the disclosure is frontend mock data rather than trusted audit evidence.
- Submit and Retry append one fresh record; conversation selection restores only the owning records.
- Focused tests pass: 4 files, 66 tests.
- `npm run verify` passes with 92 frontend tests, 50 Rust library tests, 6 Rust integration tests, Vite builds, and the Tauri release no-bundle build.
- `npm audit --audit-level=low` reports zero vulnerabilities.
- Native Tauri development launch passes with idempotent storage startup and two migrations already applied.
- Project-owner native interaction, per-conversation restoration, minimum-window layout, and existing native regression checks passed.

## Phase 3 planning result

- The current mock loop already covers messages, streaming, Stop, mock tool activity, mock approval decisions, bounded failure, Retry, stale-event rejection, and redacted Activity presentation.
- The current transcript has no conversation identity or history, and New Request clears only the draft.
- Increment 3A adds volatile conversation sessions, bounded titles, newest-first history, New conversation, and idle selection without persistence or trust-boundary expansion.
- Active and retryable runs are bound to conversation IDs; session changes fail closed while streaming or awaiting approval.
- `npm run verify` passed with 83 frontend tests, 50 Rust library tests, 6 Rust integration tests, Vite production build, and Tauri release no-bundle build.
- The dependency audit reports zero vulnerabilities, and native launch passed with idempotent storage startup.
- No dependency, lockfile, Rust, Tauri, IPC, SQLite, capability, CSP, credential, network, packaging, or permission file changed.
- The project owner confirmed conversation layout, creation, restoration, empty-session reuse, busy-state guards, native New Request behavior, existing mock interactions, Activity redaction, lifecycle, diagnostics, storage, and no-permission-prompt behavior all passed.
